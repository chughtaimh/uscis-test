# U.S. Citizenship Practice Test App

This U.S. Citizenship Practice Test app is a simple, interactive tool designed to help users prepare for the U.S. citizenship civics test. By providing questions commonly found on the actual USCIS civics test, this app aims to enhance users' readiness through practice and immediate feedback.

## Features

- **Interactive Practice Test**: Engage with questions that simulate the format of the real USCIS civics test.
- **Instant Feedback**: Select answers and immediately find out if they were correct or incorrect.
- **Randomized Questions**: Questions are presented in a random order each session to ensure a comprehensive review.
- **Review Mode**: At the end of each session, review incorrect answers to learn and improve.
- **Accessible Design**: Simple, user-friendly interface suitable for all users, regardless of technical skill.

## Installation

This app runs directly in any modern web browser without the need for additional installations. To use the app, simply open the provided HTML file in a web browser, or visit: https://chughtaimh.github.io/uscis-test/

## Usage

1. **Start the Test**: The app automatically loads a new set of questions each time it is opened.
2. **Answer Questions**: Click on the options to select your answer. Confirm whether the selected answer is correct by using the "Got it right" or "Got it wrong" buttons.
3. **Navigate**: Use the "Next Question" button to move to the next question.
4. **End of Test**: After 10 questions or once you've cycled through the available questions, the app will display your score and any incorrect answers for review.
5. **Restart Test**: Click the "New Test" button to reset the session and start over with new random questions.

## How It Works

The app utilizes a simple array of objects, each representing a question with its options and the correct answer. Interaction with these questions is managed through JavaScript functions that control the display of questions, the selection of answers, and the navigation between different app states (quiz, results, new test).

## Customization

Developers can easily modify or extend the app by altering the HTML or JavaScript code. For example, more questions can be added to the array, or the styling can be changed to match specific preferences.
